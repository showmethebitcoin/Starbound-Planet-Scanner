Starbound-Planet-Scanner
========================

Finally, an automatic way to log planets with no typing! Using a custom OCR (optical character recognition) engine, I've created a program that can interpret screenshots of the Starbound Planet Navigator. Simply open Starbound, open the navigator, mouse over the planet you want to log and hit print-screen. If you hear a ding, it worked!

Once the planets are logged in a sortable spreadsheet notes can be added or details can be changed.

**Limitations:**
This program scans the active monitor when print screen is pressed, it will not work is Starbound is minimized or on a secondary monitor.
The mouse cursor must be over the targeted planet (otherwise it just logs the system.

Want more features? Maybe buy me a beer and we can talk about it:
